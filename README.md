# ISRaD
Repository for the development and release of ISRaD data and tools

Visit [soilradiocarbon.org](www.soilradiocarbon.org) for more information

# The ISRaD R package is now on CRAN! 
Note that as ISRaD data is stored here on github, rather than inside of the R package, you will always be able to access the latest data directly from the version of ISRaD on CRAN.

However, we are always working to improve the code and provide minor updates. So, if you're interested in using the latest (beta) version of ISRaD, you can download it directly from github. Open your R console and run the following code:

```
devtools::install_github("International-Soil-Radiocarbon-Database/ISRaD/Rpkg", ref="master")
```
