## What is ISRaD?
ISRaD is a open community repository for soil radiocarbon data.
Our goals are:
* To improve the use of radiocarbon as a constraint for understanding the soil carbon cycle
* To provide a place for researchers to contribute their soil radiocarbon data once their paper is published
* To produce tools to make the repository useful

ISRaD has been developed as a collaboration between the U.S. Geological Survey Powell Center and the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, with support from U.S. Department of Agriculture.

## Publications
The database is described in detail in the following publication from the core ISRaD group:

* Lawrence, C. R., Beem-Miller, J., Hoyt, A. M., Monroe, G., Sierra, C. A., Stoner, S., Heckman, K., Blankinship, J. C., Crow, S. E., McNicol, G., Trumbore, S., Levine, P. A., Vindušková, O., Todd-Brown, K., Rasmussen, C., Hicks Pries, C. E., Schädel, C., McFarlane, K., Doetterl, S., Hatté, C., He, Y., Treat, C., Harden, J. W., Torn, M. S., Estop-Aragonés, C., Asefaw Berhe, A., Keiluweit, M., Della Rosa Kuhnen, Á., Marin-Spiotta, E., Plante, A. F., Thompson, A., Shi, Z., Schimel, J. P., Vaughn, L. J. S., von Fromm, S. F., and Wagai, R.: An open-source database for the synthesis of soil radiocarbon data: International Soil Radiocarbon Database (ISRaD) version 1.0, Earth Syst. Sci. Data, 12, 61–76, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-61-2020, 2020.

ISRaD builds on previously published compilcations of soil radiocarbon measurements but also includes data ingested from individual studies not captured by those prior efforts. The following compilation studies served as our starting point for data ingestion:

* Mathieu, J. A., Hatté, C., Balesdent, J., & Parent, É. (2015). Deep soil carbon dynamics are driven more by soil type than by climate: a worldwide meta-analysis of radiocarbon profiles. Global Change Biology, 21(11), 4278–4292. <a href="http://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13012">http://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13012</a>

* He, Y., Trumbore, S. E., Torn, M. S., Harden, J. W., Vaughn, L. J. S., Allison, S. D., & Randerson, J. T. Radiocarbon constraints imply reduced carbon uptake by soils during the 21st century. Science, 355(6306), 1419–1424. <a href="http://doi.org/10.1126/science.aad4273">http://doi.org/10.1126/science.aad4273</a>

Prior to ingenstion of data included in these past efforts, we fixed a number of errors, added missing data, and populated DOI numbers for all original source studies. Please also see the <a href="https://international-soil-radiocarbon-database.github.io/ISRaD/credits/">Credits</a> page for a full list of all original data sources included in the current version of ISRaD.

## Terms of Use

The ISRaD database is currently under development: <a href="https://github.com/International-Soil-Radiocarbon-Database/ISRaD"> https://github.com/International-Soil-Radiocarbon-Database/ISRaD </a>.

Users citing ISRaD should use the citation at the top of this page as well as the most recent official data release at the time that they accessed the data. In their citation of the official release, users should also reference the version of the data they used (e.g., v1.2.3.2019-12-20).

If you are interested in contributing to the development of the ISRadD R Package or site, please contact info.israd@gmail.com or make a pull request to our github repo.
