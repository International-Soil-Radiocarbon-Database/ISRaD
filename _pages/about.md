## What is ISRaD?
ISRaD is a open community repository for soil radiocarbon data.  
Our goals are:
* To improve the use of radiocarbon as a constraint for understanding the soil carbon cycle
* To provide a place for researchers to contribute their soil radiocarbon data once their paper is published
* To produce tools to make the repository useful 

ISRaD has been developed as a collaboration between the U.S. Geological Survey Powell Center and the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, with support from U.S. Department of Agriculture.

## Publications
ISRaD builds on previously published compilcations of soil radiocarbon measurements but also includes data ingested from individual studies not captured by those prior efforts. The following compilation studies served as our starting point for data ingestion: 

Mathieu, J. A., Hatté, C., Balesdent, J., & Parent, É. (2015). Deep soil carbon dynamics are driven more by soil type than by climate: a worldwide meta-analysis of radiocarbon profiles. Global Change Biology, 21(11), 4278–4292. <a href="http://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13012">http://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13012</a>

He, Y., Trumbore, S. E., Torn, M. S., Harden, J. W., Vaughn, L. J. S., Allison, S. D., & Randerson, J. T. Radiocarbon constraints imply reduced carbon uptake by soils during the 21st century. Science, 355(6306), 1419–1424. <a href="http://doi.org/10.1126/science.aad4273">http://doi.org/10.1126/science.aad4273</a>

Prior to ingenstion of data included in these past efforts, we fixed a number of errors, added missing data, and populated DOI numbers for all original source studies. Please also see the <a href="https://international-soil-radiocarbon-database.github.io/ISRaD/credits/">Credits</a> page for a full list of all original data sources included in the current version of ISRaD.
