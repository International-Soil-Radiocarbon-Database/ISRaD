## News - Updates 2021
* **5 July**: The first in-person ISRaD Hackathon of 2021 is live in Jena, Germany.
* **11 March**: Chen et al. from the Chinese Academy of Sciences published a [study](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13723) titled "Soil carbon persistence governed by plant input and mineral protection at regional and global scales" using ISRaD data!
* **9 March**: Wang et al. from CSIRO published a [study](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JG006205) titled "Microbial Activity and Root Carbon Inputs Are More Important than Soil Carbon Diffusion in Simulating Soil Carbon Profiles" using ISRaD data!

## News - Updates 2020
* **30 October**: Thermal fractionation, or "dirt burner", data can now be ingested into ISRaD! Be sure to use the [latest version](https://github.com/International-Soil-Radiocarbon-Database/ISRaD) of the ISRaD R package for updated fraction vocabulary, and take a look at [this list](https://github.com/FluvialSeds/RPO_Database) to find examples of dirt burner data already in ISRaD.
* **1 August**: Sophie von Fromm is the new ISRaD Editor, who will manage new data submissions and lead the maintenance of the database! Contact her at <a href="mailto:info.israd@gmail.com">info.israd@gmail.com</a>
* **20 July**: Sharon A. Billings and Lígia F.T. de Souza from the University of Kansas [published a discussion](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-020-0614-1) of [Shi et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-020-0596-z)'s study using ISRaD data.
* **7 July**: A collaboration led by [Dr. Christina Schädel](https://www2.nau.edu/schuurlab-p/Schaedel.html) with many ISRaD members published a [new manuscript](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/1511/2020/) describing the Soil Incubation Database [(SIDb)](https://github.com/SoilBGC-Datashare/sidb), a repository for incubation time series data built with lessons learned from ISRaD.
* **29 June**: The first [publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-020-0596-z) using the ISRaD dataset was released, led by [Dr. Zheng Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vwdpYyAAAAAJ&hl=en) at UC Irvine!
* **10 February**: ISRaD is now on CRAN!
* **6 January**: Our [ISRaD v1.0 manuscript](https://earth-syst-sci-data.net/12/61/2020/) was published in Earth System Science Data!
* Two synthesis datasets were ingested into ISRaD: permafrost peat radiocarbon from [Treat et al., 2016](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015JG003061) and Estop-Argonés (in review).
* More spatial datasets are always being added to ISRaD Extra.
