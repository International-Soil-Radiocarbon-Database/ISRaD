## R Package
The ISRaD R package provides the full database, and functions to work with the data. The compiled raw data is stored as an R object "ISRaD_data" which is automatically downloaded with the package. The R object "ISRaD_extra" is a data product with the same structure in which some fields and calculations have been filled in for the user. [Documentation here](https://github.com/International-Soil-Radiocarbon-Database/ISRaD/raw/master/ISRaD.pdf)
