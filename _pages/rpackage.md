## R Package
The compiled raw data is stored as an R object "ISRaD_data" which can be downloaded as a .zip file or through the R package (see below). The R object "ISRaD_extra" is a data product with the same structure in which some fields and calculations have been filled in for the user. The ISRaD R package includes the functions used to compile this data functions to work with the database. [Documentation here](https://github.com/International-Soil-Radiocarbon-Database/ISRaD/raw/master/ISRaD.pdf)
