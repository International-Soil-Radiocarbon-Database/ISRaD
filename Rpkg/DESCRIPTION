Description: This is the central location for data and tools for the development, 
    maintenance, analysis, and deployment of the International Soil Radiocarbon Database 
    (ISRaD). ISRaD was developed as a collaboration between the U.S. Geological Survey 
    Powell Center and the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry. This R package provides 
    tools for accessing and manipulating ISRaD data, compiling local data using the ISRaD 
    data structure, and simple query and reporting functions for ISRaD. For more detailed 
    information visit the ISRaD website at: <https://soilradiocarbon.org/>.
