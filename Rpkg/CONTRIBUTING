# Coding conventions

Below are some general coding conventions used in this project.

1) Methods documentation need to be written in complete sentences and should contain examples.

2) Avoid overloading variables whenever possible (ie 'return' should not be a variable since it is a already a function).

3) Use whitespace in code. Please indent your if/for-code blocks. Use spaces between operators. Offset with empty lines and label code chunks.

4) Line length should be 80 characters.
