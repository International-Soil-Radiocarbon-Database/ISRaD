A new manuscript detailing the construction and utilization of ISRaD was just published in Earth System Science Data. Hear we describe database fundamentals, and the application of radiocarbon data for describing the earth system. You can find the manuscript [here](https://earth-syst-sci-data.net/12/61/2020/ "ISRaD v1.0 Manuscript"). 

## What is ISRaD?
ISRaD is a open community repository for soil radiocarbon data.  
Our goals are:
* To improve the use of radiocarbon as a constraint for understanding the soil carbon cycle
* To provide a place for researchers to contribute their soil radiocarbon data once their paper is published
* To produce tools to make the repository useful 

ISRaD has been developed as a collaboration between the U.S. Geological Survey Powell Center and the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry.
