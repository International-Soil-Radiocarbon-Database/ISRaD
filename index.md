# Welcome to ISRaD
The International Soil Radiocarbon Database (ISRaD) is a living repository for radiocarbon data collected in soil systems. ISRaD consists of a database, an R package, and an international scientific community.

## ISRaD Version 1.0
Our initial manuscript detailing the construction and utilization of ISRaD was published in [Earth System Science Data]({{"https://www.earth-system-science-data.net/"}}). Here we describe database fundamentals, and the application of radiocarbon data for describing the earth system. You can find the manuscript [here]({{"https://earth-syst-sci-data.net/12/61/2020/"}}).

## What is ISRaD?
ISRaD is a open community repository for soil radiocarbon data.
Our goals are:
* To improve the use of radiocarbon as a constraint for understanding the soil carbon cycle
* To provide a place for researchers to contribute their soil radiocarbon data once their paper is published
* To produce tools to make the repository useful

ISRaD has been developed as a collaboration between the U.S. Geological Survey Powell Center and the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry.
