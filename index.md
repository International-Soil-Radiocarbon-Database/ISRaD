## What is ISRaD?
ISRaD is a open community repository for soil radiocarbon data.  
Our goals are:
* To improve the use of radiocarbon as a constraint for understanding the soil carbon cycle
* To provide a place for researchers to contribute their soil radiocarbon data once their paper is published
* To produce tools to make the repository useful 

ISRaD has been developed as a collaboration between the U.S. Geological Survey Powell Center and the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry.
