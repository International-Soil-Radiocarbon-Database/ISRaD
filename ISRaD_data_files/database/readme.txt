## Readme for ISRaD_database_files

The most up-to-date ISRaD data are contained within the zipfile "ISRaD_database_files.zip" (this directory)

# Versioning
File names contain the version number and date on which the file was generated.

# "ISRaD_data" vs "ISRaD_extra"
"ISRaD_data" files contain the raw database compiled from previous studies
"ISRaD_extra" includes several new variables created from the raw data and additional features, such as geospatial variables filled from external databases using geospatial coordinates.

# File types
The data is offered in several formats: R list objects (.rda), hierarchical format like template file (.xlsx), flat files (.csv). The flat files are for users who only want data at a certain level. For example, if you are interested only in fraction data, the flat_fraction CSV file contains this data in an easy to use format and includes information from the previous levels (ie. site, profile, and layer levels as well).
